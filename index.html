		<p>

		<h2>The Mechanics</h2>

		<p> Our game works on a very simple mechanic - The recognition of a fallacy -  If the player gets one wrong <br>then their scandal bar will go down, get one right and the bar will go up. As the game starts you are faced  <br>with opponents that are along the lines of trumps political affiliation, but as the game progresses you get to <br>fight the progressives! Dont let logic that makes actual sense get to you! You're <strong>Donald J. Trump</strong> after all!</p>
